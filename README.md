### Our Hypothesis
Because we're dealing with sound and vibrating plates, the wave equation immediately comes to mind as a suitable mathematical model. So why not model the plates in this way, and see if they hold up to that theory? [Here](https://github.com/salcott01/Chladni_Project/blob/main/thry.pdf) I've attached a short 3-page summary on the theory behind these driven vibrations. Based on this theory, we expect to find our first resonant frequency at about 7000 Hz (the speed of sound in shear aluminum is apparently ~3000 m/s)---noticeably disparate from the the first frequency at which we were able to observe nodal lines (around 200 Hz). And indeed, the plates host several characteristics that prevent them from being compared to the ideal 2D membrane and, thus making the wave equation an unapt descriptor. Probably the most damning of them all is the fact that aluminun is quite rigid and vibration causes motion along all axes at each point. This motion is probably best characterized by some combination of wave and material deformation.
